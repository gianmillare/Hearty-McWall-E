                <h3>Project Title</h3>
                <p> Cardiovascular disease is a crippling condition that is easily preventable with proper daily habits. Utilizing modern technology - 
                    more specifically machine learning classification models - our project aims to whether a person is at risk for heart disease, and 
                    provide a meaningful suggestion to lower that risk. In this project, we focus primarily on heart disease, but these models have a 
                    meaningful contribution towards health risk classifications such as cancer, suicide rates, and happiness levels.
                </p>

                <h3>Project Description</h3>
                <p> Using the datasets cited below, we determined features that are paramount to the predictive model. For example, resting blood pressure, 
                    cholesterol, fasted blood sugar, etc. Application users will input answers via a survey into the model, and the output will display
                    a evaluative prediction and a recommended action, similar to: “You have a 78.42% chance of having Heart Disease! We suggest ample rest,
                    less grease, non-stressful activities, and light exercise.”

                <h3>Project Guidelines</h3>
                <p>Step 1: Clean the data, and ensure that the model is only using data that is essential to the results. This is solely for preparing the data that we think we can use for the models in Step 2.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 2: Define the features for the Predictive model. These features will need to take into account mental health issues as well because some heart-related events may include mental health measurements (i.e. depression).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 3: Test models. We expect to use Random Forest and Neural Networks (Deep Learning) to make predictions on identifying health issues.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 4: Analyze data and determine the best model. Although multiple models will be created, we expect to use the model(s) that best fits the features chosen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 5: Creating the website: The home page will contain a small summary and a welcome message to explain to the users what the application should be used for.
                    Underneath this message will be a total of 10 questions. These questions will have a drop down menu with values ranging from “yes” and “no” variables, and numerical values. Depending on the values inputted by the user, a prediction will be displayed once prompted. This website will display a pleasing and easily understood UI.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Step 6: Present: Interpret the data and help comprehend what the model has returned.
                </p>
                <br>
